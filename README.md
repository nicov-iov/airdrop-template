# ERC1155 Airdrop Smart Contracts Template
This project is an open-source template for creating an ERC1155 airdrop smart contract on the RSK network. The template is designed to be easy to use and customize, and it includes a simple example of how to create an airdrop campaign and distribute tokens to multiple recipients.

## Deployment
The smart contracts in this template can be deployed to the RSK network using the next command:
```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/AirdropManager.ts --network rskTestnet
```

It will deploy the `AirdropManager`, `AirdropDeployerERC20Module` & `AirdropDeployerERC1155Module` contracts and its dependencies to the RSK Testnet network. You should see a response like:
```bash
Hardhat Ignition üöÄ

```
> Also, you can see the deployed contracts in the `ignition/deployments/chain-31/deployed_addresses` folder.

## Verify Contracts
To verify the contracts on the RSK network, you can use the next command:
1. AirdropDeployerERC1155
```bash
npx hardhat verify --network rskTestnet 0x49dbbA265c0f4a7Ca8C277F57E189f6B90998aEE
```
***Note: Replace the address `0x49dbbA265c0f4a7Ca8C277F57E189f6B90998aEE` with the address of the contract you want to verify.***

2. AirdropDeployerERC20
```bash
npx hardhat verify --network rskTestnet 0xe68B923822E0b9067413be380dBED46f295F2372
```
***Note: Replace the address `0xe68B923822E0b9067413be380dBED46f295F2372` with the address of the contract you want to verify.***

3. AirdropManager, for this contract verification, you need to pass the constructor arguments in the file `AirdropManagerArguments.js`, so make sure you replace them with your own args:
```bash
npx hardhat verify --constructor-args AirdropManagerArguments.js --network rskTestnet 0xFdEdc1427b745D9876B5BBF21e2F57922CF78117
```
You should see a response like this in each verification:
```bash
Successfully verified contract AirdropDeployerERC20 on the block explorer.
https://rootstock-testnet.blockscout.com/address/0xe68B923822E0b9067413be380dBED46f295F2372#code
```

## Deploy ERC1155
We have included an ERC1155 contract in the `contracts/ERC1155/Erc1155.sol` file. You can modify it as needed and deploy it to the RSK network.

To deploy your ERC1155 contract, you can use the next command:
```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/ERC1155.ts --network rskTestnet
```
And then you can use the next command to verify the contract:
```bash
npx hardhat verify --network rskTestnet 0xe68B923822E0b9067413be380dBED46f295F2372
```
## Smart Contracts Reference

### 1. **Administrable.sol**

The `Administrable.sol` contract provides the foundation for managing administrator roles within the system.

- **License and Version**: SPDX License Identifier: MIT, Solidity Compiler Version: 0.8.19.
- **Contract Declaration**: Defines the `Administrable` contract.
- **Mapping**: Tracks admin addresses with a `mapping(address => bool) _admins`.
- **Constructor**: Initializes the contract by adding initial admins from an array.
- **Modifier**: `onlyAdmins` restricts functions to admins.
- **Functions**:
  - `isAdmin`: Checks if an address is an admin.
  - `addAdmin`: Adds a new admin.
  - `removeAdmin`: Removes an existing admin.

### 2. **AirdropManager.sol**

`AirdropManager.sol` is responsible for managing different types of airdrops and facilitating the claiming process.

- **Imports**: The `Administrable` contract is imported.
- **Enum**: `AirdropType` defines two types of airdrops: CUSTOM and MERKLE.
- **Struct**: `AirdropInfo` stores essential information about each airdrop.
- **Interface**: `IAirdrop1155` defines required functions for ERC-1155 airdrop contracts.
- **Inheritance**: `AirdropManager` inherits from `Administrable`, allowing admin management.
- **Functions**:
  - `claim`: Allows users to claim airdrop tokens.
  - `hasClaimed`, `hasExpired`, `isAllowed`, `getExpirationDate`, `getClaimAmount`, `getAirdropInfo`, `getTotalAirdropAmount`: Provide data related to the airdrop.

### 3. **CustomAirdrop1155.sol**

This contract implements logic for distributing tokens using the ERC-1155 standard, supporting multi-token airdrops.

- **Imports**: Utilizes the `Ownable` contract from OpenZeppelin for ownership management.
- **Interface**: The `IERC1155` interface defines essential token transfer functions.
- **Functions**:
  - `claim`: Allows the owner to facilitate claims.
  - `allowAddress`, `disallowAddress`: Manage which addresses can claim tokens.
  - `hasClaimed`, `hasExpired`, `getAirdropInfo`: Retrieve data without modifying the contract state.

### 4. **CustomAirdrop1155ClaimMerkle.sol**

Extends the functionality of `CustomAirdrop1155.sol` by incorporating Merkle Tree validation for claims.

- **Imports**: Includes the `MerkleProof` library for efficient address verification.
- **Functions**:
  - `claim`: Allows users to claim tokens using Merkle Proofs.
  - `setRoot`: Allows the owner to set the Merkle root for the airdrop.
  - `_claim`: Internal function to handle the logic for verifying Merkle Proofs and facilitating claims.

### 5. **Erc1155.sol**

Implements the ERC-1155 standard for managing multiple token types and enabling transfers of various tokens.

- **Imports**: Leverages OpenZeppelin's `ERC1155` and `Ownable` contracts.
- **Functions**:
  - `mint`: Allows the owner to mint tokens.
  - `mintBatch`: Facilitates minting multiple token types in a single transaction.
